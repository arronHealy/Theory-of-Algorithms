# Introduction
This repository contains the submission for my 4th year Bs.c Computing in Software Development module in GMIT, <b>Theory of Algorithms</b>. This module provides an introduction to the theory of algorithms, especially the areas of computation and computability. Students will also learn practical skills in the development of software using a selection of programming paradigms.

<br>

The following are the defined learning outcomes on completion of this module:

1. Compare different models of computation.

2. Write computer programs using a selection of programming paradigms.

3. Analyse the complexity of an algorithm.

4. Identify difficult computational problems in everyday programming.

## About the Repository
The contents of this repository was developed from the beginning of January to the end of April 2020. The main files that relate to the project specification for this module can be found in the <i>theory-of-algorithms-project</i> folder. The other folders contain code that was developed over the course of the module through a series of video/lab lectures that had been prepared for us by our lecturer for this module. The code that is contained in this repository was mainly developed using the <i>vi text editor</i> on a <i>Debian virtual machine</i> that was hosted by <i>Google cloud platform</i>. Any work done on my own machine was developed using <i>visual studio code</i> in conjunction with the <i>Windows sub-system for Linux</i> that used <i>Ubuntu 18.04</i>.

The following is a brief description of the other folders in this repository that do not relate to the main project for this module:

* <b>hello-programs:</b>

The hello-programs folder contains two hello world programs, one written in C and the other in python. This was done as part of an introduction to this module where our lecturer took us through the steps to set up a virtual machine using the Google cloud platform. The virtual machine ran using a Debian OS image and after installing the necessary libraries needed to execute C and python programs these files were developed. 

* <b>c-bit-operations:</b>

The c-bit-operations folder contains C program files that were developed as part of the video lectures series. The purpose of these lectures was to further our understanding of how data is represented and manipulated the bit level using C. These videos were of great help in the lead up to the development of the main project for this module.

* <b>sha256:</b>

The sha256 folder contains code written in C that was developed over the last few videos in the series as a side project where we developed the sha256 hashing algorithm. In the README.md for this repository a link is provided to the main source used in the development of this algorithm along with some example testing output presented to show the reader the contents of a file after it has been processed by the program and comparing it with the openssl's version of the sha256.
